# Computer Vision (2019-2020)


## Aims:
This course aims to introduce the concepts, theories and state-of-the-art algorithms for visual learning and recognition. 

The first half of the module is for formulations and theories of machine learning techniques, focused on discriminative classifier learning. 

The latter half leads to the topics of visual recognition by the machine learning techniques learnt, including object detection, object categorisation, face recognition, and segmentation.

Python and Tensorflow Tutorial
